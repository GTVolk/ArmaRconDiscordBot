# readLog

## Setup:
ReadLog is a python script designed to be a flexible interface of reading all kinds of log files. <br>
It's main purpose is to listen to a servers log file and wait for certain events to happen.
<br><br>
In the current configuration it is optimized for Arma 3 log entries.

## Features:
 * Read Logs in real time
 * Event based for all functionality 
 * uses a config consisting of regex to be easly configured for other Titles

## Usage

```python
reader = readLog("D:/Server/Arma/Logs/", maxMisisons=25)
reader.register_custom_log_event(event_name="clutter", regex="^(Overflow)") #register custom revents
reader.EH.add_Event("clutter", someFunction) #Calls "someFunction" when a log line of type "clutter" is read
                                             #Passed arguments are: event: str, payload:dict 
reader.pre_scan() #Scan existing log files, does not fire EventHandlers
asyncio.ensure_future(self.readLog.watch_log()) #Read Logs in real time
```

All data is stored in readLog.Missions in the following format:
```python
# readLog.Missions is split into the following entries:
[Server Init]
[Mission 1]
[between Mission data]
[Mission 2]
[between Mission data]
[Mission 3]
# Crash
[Server Init]
[Mission 4]
[between Mission data]
...
[currently running Mission]


# Server init and between Mission data look like this.
# 0 <= index < maxMisisons
# index = -1 the latest, currently running mission
readLog.Missions[index]["dict"] = {"Server sessionID": server_sessionID} 
readLog.Missions[index]["data"] = [ [timestamp, msg, regexMatch],
                                    [timestamp, msg],
                                    [timestamp, msg],
                                    [timestamp, msg, regexMatch],
                                    ...
                                ]



# The mission block is almost identical, just contains additional information about the mission in the header:
readLog.Missions[index]["dict"] = {"Server sessionID": server_sessionID,
                                    "Mission readname",
                                    "Mission roles assigned",
                                    "Mission reading",
                                    "Mission starting",
                                    "Mission file",
                                    ...
                                }
readLog.Missions[index]["data"] = [ [timestamp, msg, regexMatch],
                                    [timestamp, msg],
                                    [timestamp, msg],
                                    [timestamp, msg, regexMatch],
                                    ...
                                ]
                                
# To differentiate the block types simply check if the "dict" contains "Mission readname".
# The "Server sessionID" identifies all blocks from the same log file.
```
## Core Events

 * Log new: Triggered when a new log file is created and used. Gives old and new log.
 * Log line: Triggered whenever a log line is read. Gives timestamp and message.
 * Log line filtered: Triggered whenever a non "cluttered" log line is read. Gives timestamp, message and regexMatch.
 
## Arma 3 features
Provides recent mission data in a list grouped by mission.<br>
Mission events are ordered by the order they occur in the log:

 * Mission readname: contains Mission name in group 2
 * Mission roles assigned
 * Mission reading
 * Mission starting
 * Mission file: contains Mission file name in group 2 (e.g. becti_current (__cur_mp)) without extension
 * Mission world: contains Mission world in group 2 (e.g. Altis)
 * Mission directory: contains Mission in group 2 (e.g. mpmissions\\__cur_mp.Altis\\)
 * Mission read
 * Mission id: contains unique Mission id in group 2 (e.g. 13dfdd0042a09e918dfe17933d1372e6cefc3f9a). Unique for every session, if you load a save file, the id will remain identical.
 * Mission started
 * Mission finished

Additionally the following events are used:<br> 
Server info:

 * Server sessionID
 * Server online       
 * Server port         
 * Server waiting for game
 
Player info: 

 * Player modified data file
 * Player disconnected
 * Player connecting
 * Player connected
 * Player xml parse error

Battleye:

 * BattlEye initialized
 * BattlEye registering player
 * BattlEye chat message
 * BattlEye player connected
 * BattlEye player disconnected
 * BattlEye player guid
 * BattlEye player guid verified
 * BattlEye player kicked
 * BattlEye rcon admin login
 * BattlEye chat direct message
